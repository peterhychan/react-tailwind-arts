# React-Tailwind-Arts

This project is now available for [preview](https://react-tailwind-arts.hoychanan.now.sh/).

## Setup for running the project

You need an API key from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) for fetching images from its API.

You also need to add a `.env` file at the root folder of the project, and then save the API key requested from Pixabay as `REACT_APP_PIXABAY_API_KEY`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
